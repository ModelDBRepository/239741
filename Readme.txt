The R-package "GARggm" contains two functions:

- "GAR.FB", which implements the full Bayes algorithm (Algorithm 3 of Vinci et al. 2018)
- "GAR.EB", which implements the empirical Bayes algorithm (Algorithm 4 of Vinci et al. 2018). 

Information about their use can be found in R with commands "?GAR.FB" and "?GAR.EB".
